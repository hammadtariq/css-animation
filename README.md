#Animation Types 
There are two categories of animations in CSS: CSS transitions and CSS keyframe animations  
• CSS transitions are animations made by interpolating values between two distinct
states, a start state and an end state.  
• CSS keyframe animations allow for more complex animations with control over
intermediary steps besides start and end using keyframes.
